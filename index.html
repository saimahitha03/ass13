                    <h3> Inspiration Start</h3>
                    <p>Hailing from a very small town of Ranchi, Dhoni dared to dream and with courage and guts make that dream a reality. Since a very young age, he idolized Sachin Tendulkar who is known as the God of Cricket and Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan. He started his career as a Ticket Collector in Indian Railways. His hard work and never-give-up spirit finally landed him in International Cricket in 2003.</p>

He continues to inspire the younger generation with his brilliant captaincy, and out of the box thinking.Under his captaincy, he made such crucial decisions which might have been laughed upon by people, but he made them work in his favour most of the times. He ain’t called Captain Cool for nothing.He didn’t melt under pressure even once.</p>
